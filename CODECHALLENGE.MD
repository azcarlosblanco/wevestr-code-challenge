## Task List Application

Create a simple to-do list application using React.js (or Angular.js based on candidate preference) and Node.js that allows users to:
- Add tasks

- Edit tasks
- Mark tasks as completed

## Backend
- Set up a **basic Node.js server**.
- Create **REST API endpoints** to handle tasks (**Create, Read, Update, Delete**).
- Use a simple database (**MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**) for storage (based on candidate's preference).

## Testing
- Write **unit tests** for each route to ensure the API functions as expected.
- Use a testing framework of your choice (**Jest, Mocha**, etc.) to run the tests.

## Submission
- Provide your **code in a GitHub repository**.
- Include a **README file** with instructions on how to run and test the API.
